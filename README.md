# Presidential-Election-Prediction-System

This is a document classifier designed for predicting Iran presidential election, 2017 using usersâ€™ comments in social networks, especially Telegram.

The approach in use is a hybrid-approach fusing machine learning methods with lexicon-based methods.

The model is implemented in Java 8 employing Weka and NLTK libraries for training and evaluation of the models.
